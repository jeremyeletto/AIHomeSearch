## üöÄ **Instant Upgrade Feature** ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED

### Concept Overview

The "Instant Upgrade" feature represents a revolutionary approach to home visualization - a single, intelligent prompt that can analyze any property image and automatically apply the most appropriate modern upgrades based on the image content and context.

### How It Works

#### 1. **Intelligent Analysis**
The system analyzes the input image to determine:
- **Image Type**: Interior room, exterior view, specific room type
- **Current Condition**: Style, age, materials, layout
- **Upgrade Opportunities**: What improvements would have the most impact
- **Context Awareness**: Property type, architectural style, current trends

#### 2. **Adaptive Upgrade Logic**

##### **For Exterior Images:**
- **Modern Facade**: Clean white siding, contemporary materials
- **Black Trim**: Modern black window frames and accents
- **Landscaping**: Professional landscaping with mature plants
- **Lighting**: Modern exterior lighting fixtures
- **Driveway/Walkways**: Updated hardscaping materials

##### **For Interior Images:**
- **Modern Floors**: Hardwood, luxury vinyl, or polished concrete
- **Contemporary Fixtures**: Modern lighting, hardware, and appliances
- **Color Palette**: Neutral, sophisticated color schemes
- **Furniture**: Modern, minimalist furniture arrangements
- **Storage**: Built-in storage solutions and organization

##### **For Kitchen Images:**
- **Modern Cabinetry**: Sleek, handleless designs
- **Countertops**: Quartz or marble surfaces
- **Appliances**: Stainless steel, smart appliances
- **Backsplash**: Modern tile or stone features
- **Lighting**: Under-cabinet and pendant lighting

##### **For Bathroom Images:**
- **Modern Fixtures**: Contemporary vanities and faucets
- **Tile Work**: Large-format tiles, modern patterns
- **Lighting**: LED mirrors and ambient lighting
- **Storage**: Floating vanities and built-in storage
- **Hardware**: Matte black or brushed metal finishes

#### 3. **Smart Prompt Generation**

The system dynamically creates context-aware prompts:

```javascript
// Example logic for Instant Upgrade
if (imageType === 'exterior') {
    prompt = generateExteriorModernizationPrompt(imageAnalysis);
} else if (imageType === 'kitchen') {
    prompt = generateKitchenModernizationPrompt(imageAnalysis);
} else if (imageType === 'living_room') {
    prompt = generateLivingRoomModernizationPrompt(imageAnalysis);
}
```

### Technical Implementation

#### 1. **Prompt Configuration** ‚úÖ COMPLETED
```json
{
  "instant-upgrade": {
    "id": "INSTANT_UPGRADE_000",
