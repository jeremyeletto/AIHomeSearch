# Supabase Integration Objectives

## Primary Goals

### 1. User Authentication System
- **Login/Signup Interface**: Add login and signup buttons to the website
- **Google/Gmail Authentication**: Users can sign in using their Google accounts
- **Additional Auth Methods**: Support for phone/SMS authentication and other providers
- **Session Management**: Keep users logged in across visits

### 2. User Image Gallery
- **Personal Dashboard**: Logged-in users can access their generated images
- **Before/After Display**: Show images in card-style UI with before/after comparison
- **Image History**: Display all previously generated home upgrade images
- **Card UI Features**:
  - Split image showing "BEFORE" and "AFTER" states
  - Property address and upgrade type
  - "View Details" button for expanded view
  - Clean, modern design with rounded corners

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema âœ… COMPLETED
- `profiles` table: User information and preferences
- `generated_images` table: Store original and generated images with metadata
- Row Level Security: Users can only access their own data

### Authentication Flow
- Frontend: Supabase Auth UI components
- Backend: JWT token verification for protected routes
- Storage: User images saved to Supabase Storage with user-specific folders

### UI Components Needed
1. **Authentication UI**: Login/signup buttons and forms
2. **User Dashboard**: "My Images" page with card grid layout
3. **Image Cards**: Before/after comparison cards matching the reference design
4. **Navigation**: User menu with logout functionality

## Current Progress
- âœ… Supabase project created and configured
- âœ… Database tables and security policies created
- âœ… Environment variables configured
- âœ… Google OAuth authentication working
- âœ… User dashboard with image cards implemented
- âœ… Authentication UI components built
- âœ… Image storage and retrieval working
- âœ… Property address integration with Realtor16 API

## Property Address Integration - COMPLETED âœ…

### Problem Solved
The "My Images" section was showing "Property Address" instead of actual property addresses when saving generated images.

### Root Cause
The image saving process was not fetching detailed property information from the Realtor16 API before storing images in Supabase.

### Solution Implemented

#### 1. Modal Data Storage
- **File**: `assets/js/mobile-view.js`
- **Function**: `handleModalOpen()`
- **Purpose**: Extract and store property data when upgrade modal opens
- **Implementation**: 
  ```javascript
  CONFIG.currentPropertyData = {
      id: homeId,
      address: address,
      price: price,
      bedrooms: bedrooms,
      bathrooms: bathrooms,
      sqft: sqft,
      href: home.href
  };
  ```

#### 2. Property Details API Endpoint
- **File**: `server.js`
- **Endpoint**: `/api/realtor/property-details`
- **Purpose**: Fetch complete property information from Realtor16 API
- **Implementation**: Uses Realtor16 property details API to get full address, price, bedrooms, bathrooms, sqft

#### 3. Enhanced Image Saving
- **Files**: `assets/js/upgrade-ui.js` and `assets/js/mobile-view.js`
- **Function**: `saveGeneratedImageToSupabase()`
- **Purpose**: Fetch detailed property data before saving to Supabase
- **Flow**:
  1. Use stored property data from modal
  2. Fetch detailed property info from Realtor16 API
  3. Save complete address and property details to Supabase

#### 4. Address Construction
- **Source**: Realtor16 API response structure
- **Components**: `address.line`, `city`, `state_code`, `postal_code`
- **Format**: "123 Main St, City, State 12345"

### Technical Details

#### Data Flow
1. **Modal Opens** â†’ Extract property data from card â†’ Store in `CONFIG.currentPropertyData`
2. **User Generates Upgrade** â†’ `upgrade-ui.js` saves image
3. **Before Saving** â†’ Fetch detailed property info from Realtor16 API using stored `href`
4. **Save to Supabase** â†’ Complete address and property details saved

#### Key Functions Added
- `handleModalOpen()` - Stores property data when modal opens
- `fetchPropertyDetails(propertyId)` - Fetches detailed info from Realtor16 API
- `getPropertyDataFromModal()` - Uses stored data instead of DOM traversal

#### Error Handling
- Falls back to stored modal data if API fetch fails
- Graceful degradation with default values
- Extensive console logging for debugging

### Result
- âœ… Real property addresses now saved to Supabase
- âœ… "My Images" page displays actual addresses instead of "Property Address"
- âœ… Complete property information (price, bedrooms, bathrooms, sqft) stored
- âœ… Robust error handling and fallback mechanisms

### Files Modified
- `assets/js/mobile-view.js` - Modal data storage and property fetching
- `assets/js/upgrade-ui.js` - Enhanced image saving with property details
- `server.js` - New property details API endpoint
- `assets/js/config.js` - Fixed API base URL
